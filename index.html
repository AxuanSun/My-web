        	<p class="firstp">Hello! I'm Axuan Sun - I take steady steps, towards a better life.</p><p class="p1"> As a current Master of Information Technology at the University of Technology Sydney, I am incredibly interested in front-end development. Over the past years, I used to take many detours on careers. But it's not too late to start today. I have solid experience in HTML5, CSS, UX/UI design, currently studying Javascript as well. As a fast learner, I would apply my passion and motivation for web development in a team working environment.

        	<p class="p2">
 		I believe that God rewards those who work hard. So that I practice to build website day after day, with a modest attitude and mindfulness on the project. Meanwhile, I also pay lots of attention to expending practical skills in other relevant fields on web development. Such as backend and the server side.</p>

I am fascinated by the mix of qualitative and quantitative elements of developing methods to increase interest around content. It can be time consuming to dedicate staff to manage your digital services, such as your website, social media and online marketing. I offer a one stop solution for your marketing needs by ensuring that your website stays current and useful and by looking after all your online marketing activities.
